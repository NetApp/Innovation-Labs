The license is perpetual and includes 1 year of support and maintenance. The license is tied to the connector and is not transferable. The license does not require an internet connection for activation.</p><h3 id="does-the-netapp-neo-connector-for-m365-copilot-support-multiple-file-shares" tabindex="-1">Does the NetApp Neo: Connector for M365 Copilot support multiple file shares? <a class="header-anchor" href="#does-the-netapp-neo-connector-for-m365-copilot-support-multiple-file-shares" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Does the NetApp Neo: Connector for M365 Copilot support multiple file shares?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Yes, the NetApp Neo: Connector for M365 Copilot supports multiple file shares. You can configure multiple file shares in the connector and manage them through the API interface. A shares API endpoint is available for managing and monitoring the file shares. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of file shares that can be connected to the connector. In a real-world deployment, the number of file shares that can be connected to the connector is limited by the performance of the connector and the underlying storage system and as such should be tested in early testing before deploying to production.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-upgrade-the-netapp-neo-connector-for-m365-copilot" tabindex="-1">How do I upgrade the NetApp Neo: Connector for M365 Copilot? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-upgrade-the-netapp-neo-connector-for-m365-copilot" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I upgrade the NetApp Neo: Connector for M365 Copilot?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Simply pull the latest image from the repository and redeploy the connector.
